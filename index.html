  <h1> Storm Similie </h1>
  <hr>
  <h4>
    Clouds gather
    <br>
    like a thousand black kites
    <br>
    knotted and trapped on an endless cord
    <br><br>

    Lightening casts a luminous glare
    <br>
    and thrusts heartless flames
    <br>
    through the shadows of the night
    <br><br>

    The wind howls
    <br>
    like a thousand wolves calling
    <br>
    for their moonlight master
    <br>
    as waves of steel
    <br>
    pound like hammers
    <br>
    on my defenceless wooden craft
    <br><br>

    Sheets of rain pummel my body
    <br>
    and I watch the loose rigging
    <br>
    beat inconsistently
    <br>
    like a dying drummer on a battlefield
    <br><br>

    Untied sails flap relentlessly
    <br>
    against tired old beams
    <br>
    with sounds like wounded soldiers
    <br>
    screaming in pain
    <br><br>

    I hold the wheel and start to pray
    <br>
    as the ship pitches and rolls
    <br>
    I am nothing but a little pea
    <br>
    being tossed around in a giant boiling cauldron...
    <br><br>
